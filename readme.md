Store Locator
=============

Google MAPS API store simple store locator with distance ordering and clustering.

This is an implementation of the Google Store locator by Chris Broadfoot combined with Marker-Clusterer by the same author.

There is a minor change in the locator to accomodate the integration.

_Let me know if you spot it._
